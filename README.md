## FieldClassifier

FieldClassifier is a Qgis plugin designed to automate the field classification process based on a source file in * .shp format.

The source file should contain the "value" column corresponding to the usefulness classes 1-5 of the field.

The plugin allows you to:
- uploading a layer, 
- calculating:
    - sums of areas of selected objects, 
    - average area,
    - number of unique objects,
    - number of selected objects.
- visualization of the percentage share of each class in the total area of selected objects in the form of a graph
